	Is different in the way it works with GIT, and it is a step to make a commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can check the files which have been added so I can see if for everye change I added, there is a logical change

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
